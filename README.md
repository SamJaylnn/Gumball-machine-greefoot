# Gumball-machine-greefoot
Implement some gumball machine features on Greenfoot as follow:

• Dragging a coin over (i.e. touching) the gumball machine results in the gumball machine printing the message “have coin” to the screen. 
The coin should then disappear from the screen.

• Clicking on the gumball machine (i.e. turn crank) will get the aliens started with their work. 

• The turn crank process should end with a gumball appearing on the screen if the coin inserted was a “real” quarter.

This is a lab from SJSU CMPE 202.
